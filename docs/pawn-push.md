# Pawn push
A Pawn Push is a quiet, irreversible move of a pawn one single step forward, or
optionally but only from its initial rank, two steps forward. The condition for
a pseudo-legal pawn push is that its target square ahead, the [stop square](stop-square.md), is
empty, while the origin square is obviously occupied by the pawn of the side to
move.
